### Version Control System (VCS)

* VCS is used to store generally code (any files)
* This is a software which helps organizations to maintain the source code.
* VCS helps in maintaining history of changes
* VCS allows us to maintain track of different releases which we give to customers
* VCS allows parallel development by multiple developers
* Software which allows us to store code along with history is called as Version Control Systems.

### Evolution of VCS
